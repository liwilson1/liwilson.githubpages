      <description>Glossary Image classification Image classification is the task of assigning an input image one label from a fixed set of categories.
Transfer learning Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model trained on one task is re-purposed on a second related task. It is a popular approach for image classification as there are many pre-trained models available for use.
VGG-16 VGG-16 is a convolutional neural network architecture that was the runner-up in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2014.</description>
